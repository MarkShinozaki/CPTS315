### 4. [Final Project](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS315-IntroductionToDataMining/tree/Project)

#### [Project Proposal - Predictive Model on NYC Lottery](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS315-IntroductionToDataMining/tree/Project/Project%20Work/Project%20Proposal)

##### Data Mining Task:
- The project's primary data mining task is to perform exploratory data analysis on the winning numbers of the New York State Power Ball and Mega Millions. The ultimate goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast future winning numbers. The motivation stems from a desire to uncover any discernible patterns in the lottery data that might aid in prediction, despite acknowledging the inherent randomness of lottery number draws.

#### [Final Project Report - Overview of the Final Project: Predictive Model Using Regression for NYC Lottery, Power Ball & Mega Ball](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS315-IntroductionToDataMining/tree/Project/Project%20Work/Final%20-%20Project%20Report)


##### Project Motivation and Objectives:
- The project aimed to develop a predictive model for forecasting winning lottery numbers for Power Ball and Mega Ball. The motivation was driven by the prospect of assisting lottery participants in making informed choices, potentially enhancing their chances of securing a win. The primary goals were to:

  - Analyze historical data of winning numbers.
  - Identify common winning numbers and patterns.
  - Develop a model capable of predicting future winning numbers.
