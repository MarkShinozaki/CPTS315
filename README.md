#### By the End of the Course, Students Will Be Able To:
- Understand the challenges, algorithms, and applications of data mining tasks.
- Address scalability challenges with algorithmic solutions for scalable implementation.
- Apply basic data mining algorithms to solve real-world problems.

#### Brief List of Topics Covered:
1. Mining frequent item sets and association rules
2. Recommendation algorithms
3. Supervised learning algorithms (classification and regression tasks)
4. Data clustering algorithms
5. Outlier and anomaly detection algorithms
6. Computational advertising algorithms
7. Algorithms for mining data streams
8. Responsible data mining

#### Prerequisites:
